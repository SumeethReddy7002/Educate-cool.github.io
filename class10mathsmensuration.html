                <p> <strong>Mensuraiton</strong><br><br>
                    Mensuration is a subject of geometry. Mensuration deals with the size, region, and density of
                    <br><br>
                    different forms both 2D and 3D. Now, in the introduction to Mensuration, let’s think about 2D and 3D
                    <br><br>
                    forms and the distinction between them. <br><br>
                    <strong>Introduction to Menstruation: Important Terms</strong><br><br>
                    Until we switch to the list of important formulas for measurement, we need to clarify certain<br><br>
                    important terms that make these measurement formulas:<br><br>
                    <strong>Area (A):</strong><br><br>
                    The area is called the surface occupied by a defined closed region. It is defined by the letter A<br><br>
                    and expressed in a square unit.<br><br>
                    <strong>Perimeter (P):</strong><br><br>
                    The total length of the boundary of a figure is called its perimeter. Perimeter is determined by<br><br>
                    only two-dimensional shapes or figures. It is the continuous line along the edge of the closed<br><br>
                    vessel. It is represented by P and measures are taken in a square unit.<br><br>
                    <strong>Volume (V):</strong><br><br>
                    The width of the space contained in a three-diMensional closed shape or surface, such that, the area<br><br>
                    by a room or cylinder. Volume is denoted by the alphabet V and the SI unit of volume is the cubic meter.<br><br>
                    <strong>Curved Surface Area (CSA):</strong><br><br>
                    The curved surface area is the area of the only curved surface, ignoring the base and the top such<br><br>
                    as a sphere or a circle. The abbreviation for the curved surface area is CSA.<br><br>
                    Lateral Surface Area (LSA):<br><br>
                    The total area of all of a given figure’s lateral surfaces is called the Lateral Surface Area.<br><br>
                    Lateral surfaces are the layers covering the artefact. The acronym for the lateral surface area is LSA.<br><br>
                    <strong>Total Surface Area (TSA):</strong><br><br>
                    The calculation of the total area of all surfaces is called the Cumulative Surface Region in a<br><br>
                    closed shape. For example, we get its Total Surface Area in a cuboid by adding the area of all six<br><br>
                    surfaces. The acronym for the total surface area is TSA.<br><br>
                    <strong>Square Unit (/):</strong><br><br>
                    One square unit is simply the one-unit square area. When we quantify some surface area, we relate to<br><br>
                    the sides of one block square to know how many of these units will fit in the figure given.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cube Unit (/):</strong><br><br>
                    One cubic unit is the one-unit volume filled by a side cube. When we calculate the volume of any<br><br>
                    number, we refer to this cube of one unit and how many these component cubes will fit in the defined<br><br>
                    closed form.<br><br>
                    <strong>Tools Require for Mensuration</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Calliper</strong> <br><br>
                    A tool for measuring the diameter.<br><br>
                    <strong>Try Square</strong><br><br>
                    A tool for determining the squareness and flatness of a surface.<br><br>
                    <strong>Meter Stick</strong><br><br>
                     A measuring device with a one-meter length.<br><br>
                     <strong>Compass</strong><br><br>
                      An arc and circle drawing tool.<br><br>
                      <strong>List of Mensuration Formulas for 2D shapes:</strong><br><br>
                    As our introduction to Mensuration and the relevant words are over, let’s switch to the equations<br><br>
                    for Mensuration, as this is a discussion focused on an equation. The 2D figure has a list of<br><br>
                    formulas of measurement that define a relationship between the various parameters. Let’s look into<br><br>
