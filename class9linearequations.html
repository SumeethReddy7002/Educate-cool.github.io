                <p><strong>Equation</strong> <br><br>
                    An equation is a statement that two mathematical expressions having one or more variables are equal.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Linear Equation</strong> <br><br>
                    Equations in which the powers of all the variables involved are one are called linear equations. The
                    <br><br>
                    degree of a linear equation is always one. <br><br>
                    <strong>General form of a Linear Equation in Two Variables</strong> <br><br>
                    The general form of a linear equation in two variables is ax + by + c = 0, where a and b cannot be
                    zero simultaneously. <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution of a Linear Equation in 2 variables</strong> <br><br>
                    The solution of a linear equation in two variables is a pair of values, one for x and the other for
                    <br><br>
                    y, which makes the two sides of the equation equal. <br><br>
                    Eg: If 2x+y=4, then (0,4) is one of its solutions as it satisfies the equation. A linear equation in
                    <br><br>
                    two variables has infinitely many solutions. <br><br>
                    <strong>General form of a pair of linear equations in 2 variables</strong> <br><br>
                    A pair of linear equations in two variables can be represented as follows <br><br>
                    a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 <br><br>
                    a2x + b2y + c2 = 0 <br><br>
                    <strong>Points</strong>
                    *For any linear equation, each solution (x, y) corresponds to a point on the line. General form is
                    <br><br>
                    given by ax + by + c = 0. <br><br>
                    *The graph of a linear equation is a straight line. <br><br>
                    *Two linear equations in the same two variables are called a pair of linear equations in two
                    variable <br><br>
                    The most general form of a pair of linear equations is: a1x + b1y + c1 = 0; a2x + b2y + c2 = 0
                    <br><br>
                    where a1, a2, b1, b2, c1 and c2 are real numbers, such that a12 + b12 ≠ 0, a22 + b22 ≠ 0. <br><br>
                    *A pair of values of variables ‘x‘ and ‘y’ which satisfy both the equations in the given system of
                    <br><br>
                    equations is said to be a solution of the simultaneous pair of linear equations. <br><br>
                    *A pair of linear equations in two variables can be represented and solved, by <br><br>
                    (i) Graphical method <br><br>
                    (ii) Algebraic method <br><br>

                    <strong>(i) Graphical method.</strong> 
                    The graph of a pair of linear equations in two variables is presented by two <br><br>
                    lines. <br><br>
                    <strong>(ii) Algebraic methods.</strong> Following are the methods for finding the solutions(s) of a pair of linear
                    equations: <br><br>
                    1.Substitution method <br><br>
                    2.Elimination method <br><br>
                    3.Cross-multiplication method. <br><br>
                    *There are several situations which can be mathematically represented by two equations that are not
                    linear to start with. But we allow them so that they are reduced to a pair of linear equations. <br><br>
                    <strong>*Consistent system.</strong> A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has at least one solution. <br><br>
                    <strong>*Inconsistent system. </strong>A system of linear equations is said to be inconsistent if it has no solution. <br><br>
