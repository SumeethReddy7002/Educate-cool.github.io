                <strong>
                    I. Euclid’s Division lemma</strong>
                <p>Given two positive integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r
                    ≤ b.
                    Notice this. Each time ‘r’ is less than b. Each ‘q’ and ‘r’ is unique.
                </p><br>

                <strong>II. Application of lemma</strong>
                <p>Euclid’s Division lemma is used to find HCF of two positive integers. Example: Find HCF of 56 and 72
                    ?
                    Steps: <br> <br>
                    *Apply lemma to 56 and 72. <br> <br>
                    *Take bigger number and locate ‘b’ and ‘r’. 72 = 56 × 1 + 16 <br> <br>
                    *Since 16 ≠ 0, consider 56 as the new dividend and 16 as the new divisor. 56 = 16 × 3 + 8 <br> <br>
                    *Again, 8 ≠ 0, consider 16 as new dividend and 8 as new divisor. 16 = 8 × 2 + 0 <br> <br>
                    *Since remainder is zero, divisor (8) is HCF. <br> <br>
                    *Although Euclid’s Division lemma is stated for only positive integers, it can be extended for all
                    integers except zero, i.e., b ≠ 0. <br>
                </p><br>

                <strong>III. Constructing a factor tree
                </strong>
                <p>steps <br> <br>
                    *Write the number as a product of prime number and a composite number <br>
                    Example: <br>
                    Factorize 48 <br> <br>
                    *Repeat the process till all the primes are obtained <br>
                    ∴ Prime factorization of 48 = 24 x 3</p><br>

                <strong>IV. Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic</strong>
                <p>Every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes, and this expression is unique, apart
                    from the order in which they appear.
                </p><br>

                <strong>Applications:</strong>
                <p>*To locate HCF and LCM of two or more positive integers. <br>
                    *To prove irrationality of numbers. <br>
                    *To determine the nature of the decimal expansion of rational numbers.</p><br>

                <strong>1. Algorithm to locate HCF and LCM of two or more positive integers:</strong>
                <p>Step I:
                    Factorize each of the given positive integers and express them as a product of powers of primes in
                    ascending order of magnitude of primes. <br><br>
                    Step II:
                    To find HCF, identify common prime factor and find the least powers and multiply them to get HCF. <br><br>
                    Step III:
                    To find LCM, find the greatest exponent and then multiply them to get the LCM. <br><br> </p><br>

                <strong>2. To prove Irrationality of numbers:</strong>
                <p>*The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational. <br>
                   *The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
                    </p><br>

                <strong>3. To determine the nature of the decimal expansion of rational numbers:</strong>
                <p>*Let x = p/q, p and q are co-primes, be a rational number whose decimal expansion terminates. Then the prime factorization of’q’ is of the form 2m5n, m and n are non-negative integers.
                   *Let x = p/q be a rational number such that the prime factorization of ‘q’ is not of the form 2m5n, ‘m’ and ‘n’ being non-negative integers, then x has a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion.
