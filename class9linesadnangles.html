                    <strong>Angles and types of angles</strong><br><br>
                    When 2 rays originate from the same point at different directions, they form an angle. <br><br>
                    The rays are called arms and the common point is called the vertex <br><br>
                    <strong>Types of angles : </strong>

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Complementary Angles:</strong> <br><br>
                    Two angles whose sum is 90° are called complementary angles <br><br>
                    <strong>Supplementary Angles:</strong><br><br>
                    Two angles whose sum is 180° are called supplementary angles. <br><br>

                    <strong>Adjacent Angles:</strong><br><br>
                    Two angles are adjacent if they have a common vertex, a common arm and their<br><br>
                    non-common arms are on different sides of the common arm.<br><br>
                    ∠ABD and ∠DBC are the adjacent angles. Ray BD is their common arm and point B is their
                    common<br><br>
                    vertex. Ray BA and ray BC are non-common arms.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-2.png" alt="laa-2"> <br><br>
                    Note: ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC <br><br>
                    <strong>Vertically Opposite Angles:</strong> <br><br>
                    The vertically opposite angles formed when two lines intersect each
                    <br><br>
                    other at a point. <br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-3.png" alt="laa-3"> <br><br>
                    Two lines ABand CD intersect each other at point O, then, there are two pairs of vertically opposite
                    <br><br>
                    angles.One pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC and another pair is ∠AOC and ∠BOD. <br><br>
                    <strong>Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines</strong> <br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-4.png" alt="laa-4"> <br><br>
                    Lines PQ and RS are intersecting lines because they are intersecting each other at O. <br><br>
                    Lines AB and CD are non-intersecting (parallel) lines. <br><br>
                    Note: The lengths of the common perpendicular at different points on these parallel lines is the
                    <br><br>
                    same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines. <br><br>
                    <strong>Pairs of Angles</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>Linear Pair of Angles:</strong> <br><br>
                    When the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a linear<br><br>
                    pair of angles.<br><br>
                    (i) If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°.<br><br>
                    (ii) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is the non-common
                    arms form a line).<br><br>
                    ∠AOC + ∠BOC = 180°<br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-6.png" alt="laa-6"><br><br>
                    <strong>Property:</strong>If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are
                    equal. <br><br>
                    ∠AOD = ∠BOC<br><br>
                    ∠COA = ∠DOB<br><br>
                    <strong>10. Parallel Lines and a Transversal:</strong>A line which intersects two or more lines at
                    distinct points is called a transversal.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-7.png" alt="laa-6"> <br><br>
                    Here, line l is a transversal of the lines m and n, respectively.<br><br>
                    Line l intersects m and n at P and Q respectively, then four angles are formed at each of the
                    points<br><br>
                    P and Q namely<br><br>
                    ∠1, ∠2, ∠3,…, ∠8<br><br>
                    ∠1, ∠2, ∠7 and ∠8 are called exterior angles.<br><br>
                    ∠3, ∠4, ∠5 and ∠6 are called interior angles.<br><br>
                    We classify these eight angles in the following groups<br><br>
                    (i) Corresponding angles.<br><br>
                    ∠1 and ∠5<br><br>
                    ∠2 and ∠6<br><br>
                    ∠4 and ∠8<br><br>
                    ∠3 and ∠7<br><br>
                    (ii) Alternate interior angles<br><br>
                    ∠4 and ∠6<br><br>
                    ∠3 and ∠5<br><br>
                    (iii) Alternate exterior angles<br><br>
                    ∠1 and ∠7<br><br>
                    ∠2 and ∠8<br><br>
                    (iv) Interior angles on the same side of the transversal<br><br>
                    ∠4 and ∠5<br><br>
                    ∠3 and ∠6<br><br>
                    Note: Interior angles on the same side of the transversal are also referred to as
                    consecutive<br><br>
                    interior angles or allied angles or co-interior angles.<br><br>
                    <strong>11. Relation Between the Angles when Line m is Parallel to Line n</strong><br><br>
                    (i) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/laa-8.png" alt="laa-8"> <br><br>
                    i.e., ∠1 = ∠5, ∠2 = ∠6<br><br>
                    and ∠4 = ∠8, ∠3 = ∠7<br><br>
                    (ii) If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding angles is equal,
                    then<br><br>
                    the two lines are parallel to each other.<br><br>
                    (iii) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of alternate interior angles is
                    equal.<br><br>
                    i.e., ∠4 = ∠6 and ∠3 = ∠5<br><br>
                    (iv) If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of alternate interior angles is
                    equal,<br><br>
                    then the two lines are parallel.<br><br>
                    (v) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of interior angles on the
                    same<br><br>
                    side of the transversal is supplementary.<br><br>
                    i.e., ∠4 + ∠5 = 180°<br><br>
                    and ∠3 + ∠6 = 180°<br><br>
                    (vi) If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of interior angles on the same side
                    of<br><br>
                    the transversal is supplementary, then the two lines are parallel.<br><br>
                    <strong>12. Lines Parallel to the Same Line:</strong><br><br>
                     If two lines are parallel to the same line, will they be<br><br>
                    parallel to each other.<br><br>

                    Here, line m parallel to line l and line n parallel to line l.<br><br>
                    Hence, line m parallel to line n.<br><br>

                    (i) The sum of the angles of the triangle is 180°<br><br>
                    ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°.<br><br>

                    (ii) If a side of a triangle is produced, then the exterior angle, so formed is equal to the sum of<br><br>
                    the two interior opposite angles.<br><br>
                    ∠4 = ∠1 + ∠2<br><br>
