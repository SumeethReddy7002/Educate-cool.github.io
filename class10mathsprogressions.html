                    <strong>Sequences, Series and Progressions</strong> <br><br>
                    *A sequence is a finite or infinite list of numbers following a specific pattern. For example, 1, 2,
                    <br><br>
                    3, 4, 5,… is the sequence, an infinite sequence of natural numbers. <br><br>
                    *A series is the sum of the elements in the corresponding sequence. For example, 1+2+3+4+5….is the
                    <br><br>
                    series of natural numbers. Each number in a sequence or a series is called a term. <br><br>
                    *A progression is a sequence in which the general term can be can be expressed using a mathematical
                    formula. <br><br>
                    <strong>Arithmetic Progression</strong> <br><br>
                    An arithmetic progression (AP) is a progression in which the difference between two consecutive
                    <br><br>
                    terms is constant. <br><br>
                    Example: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14…. is an arithmetic progression <br><br>
                    <strong>Common Difference</strong> <br><br>
                    The difference between two consecutive terms in an AP, (which is constant) is the “common<br><br>
                    difference“(d) of an A.P. In the progression: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 …the common difference is 3.<br><br>
                    As it is the difference between any two consecutive terms, for any A.P, if the common difference
                    is:<br><br>
                    positive, the AP is increasing.<br><br>
                    zero, the AP is constant.<br><br>
                    negative, the A.P is decreasing.<br><br>
                    <strong>Finite and Infinite AP</strong> <br><br>
                    A finite AP is an A.P in which the number of terms is finite. For example the A.P: 2, 5, 8……32,
                    35,<br><br>
                    38<br><br>
                    An infinite A.P is an A.P in which the number of terms is infinite. For example: 2, 5, 8,
                    11…..<br><br>
                    A finite A.P will have the last term, whereas an infinite A.P won’t.<br><br>
                    <strong>General Term of AP</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>The nth term of an AP</strong> <br><br>
                    The nth term of an A.P is given by Tn= a+(n−1)d, where a is the first term, d is a common difference
                    and n is the number of terms. <br><br>
                    <strong>The general form of an AP</strong><br><br>
                    The general form of an A.P is: (a, a+d,a+2d,a+3d……) where a is the first term and d is a common
                    <br><br>
                    difference. Here, d=0, OR d>0, or d less than zero <br> <br>
                    <strong>Sum of Terms in an AP</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>The formula for the sum to n terms of an AP</strong> <br><br>
                    The sum to n terms of an A.P is given by: <br><br>
                    Sn= n/2(2a+(n−1)d) <br><br>
                    Where a is the first term, d is the common difference and n is the number of terms.<br><br>
                    The sum of n terms of an A.P is also given by<br><br>
                    Sn= n/2(a+l)<br><br>
                    Where a is the first term, l is the last term of the A.P. and n is the number of terms<br><br>
                    <strong>Arithmetic Mean (A.M)</strong> <br><br>
                    The Arithmetic Mean is the simple average of a given set of numbers. The arithmetic mean of a set
                    of<br><br>
                    numbers is given by:<br><br>
                    A.M= Sum of terms/Number of terms<br><br>
                    The arithmetic mean is defined for any set of numbers. The numbers need not necessarily be in
                    an<br><br>
                    A.P.<br><br>
                    <strong>Basic Adding Patterns in an AP</strong> <br><br>
                    The sum of two terms that are equidistant from either end of an AP is constant.<br><br>
                    For example: in an A.P: 2,5,8,11,14,17…<br><br>
                    T1+T6=2+17=19<br><br>
                    T2+T5=5+14=19 and so on….<br><br>
                    Algebraically, this can be represented as<br><br>
                    Tr+T(n−r)+1=constant<br><br>
                    <strong>Sum of first n natural numbers</strong> <br><br>
                    The sum of first n natural numbers is given by:<br><br>
                    Sn=n(n+1)/2<br><br>
                    This formula is derived by treating the sequence of natural numbers as an A.P where the first term<br><br>
                    (a) = 1 and the common difference (d) = 1.<br><br>
