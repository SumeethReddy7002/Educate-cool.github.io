                <p> <strong>Ungrouped Data</strong> <br><br>
                    Ungrouped data is data in its original or raw form. The observations are not classified into
                    groups.<br><br>
                    For example, the ages of everyone present in a classroom of kindergarten kids with the teacher is as
                    follows:<br><br>
                    3, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 27.<br><br>
                    This data shows that there is one grown-up person present in this class and that is the
                    teacher.<br><br>
                    Ungrouped data is easy to work with when the data set is small.<br><br>
                    <strong>Grouped Data</strong><br><br>
                    In grouped data, observations are organized in groups. <br> <br>
                    For example, a class of students got different marks in a school exam. The data is tabulated as
                    follows: <br> <br>
                    <img src="images/stat-1.png" alt="stat-1"><br><br>
                    <strong>Frequency</strong> <br><br>
                    Frequency is the number of times a particular observation occurs in data. <br><br>
                    <strong>Class Interval</strong> <br><br>
                    Data can be grouped into class intervals such that all observations in that range belong to that
                    class. <br><br>
                    <strong>Mean</strong> <br><br>
                    Finding the mean for Grouped Data when class Intervals are not given <br><br>
                    For grouped data without class intervals, <br><br>
                    Mean = Class width = upper class limit – lower class limit <br><br>
                    <img src="images/stat-.jpg" alt="stat" height="150"><br><br>
                    <strong>Direct method of finding mean</strong> <br><br>
                    Step 1: Classify the data into intervals and find the corresponding frequency of each class.<br><br>
                    Step 2: Find the class mark by taking the midpoint of the upper and lower class limits.<br><br>
                    Step 3: Tabulate the product of the class mark and its corresponding frequency for each
                    class.<br><br>
                    Calculate their sum (∑xifi).<br><br>
                    Step 4: Divide the above sum by the sum of frequencies (∑fi) to get the mean.<br><br>
                    <strong>relation between the Mean of deviations and mean</strong> <br><br>
                    di=xi−a<br><br>
                    Summing over all x′is,<br><br>
                    ∑di=∑xi−∑a<br><br>
                    Dividing throughout by ∑fi=n, Where ′n′ is the total number of observations.<br><br>
                    <strong>Important relations between methods of finding mean</strong> <br><br>
                    All three methods of finding mean yield the same result.<br><br>
                    Step deviation method is easier to apply if all the deviations have a common factor.<br><br>
                    Assumed mean method and step deviation method are simplified versions of the direct method.<br><br>
                    <strong>Median</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>Finding the Median of Grouped Data when class Intervals are not given</strong><br><br>
                    Step 1: Tabulate the observations and the corresponding frequency in ascending or descending
                    order.<br><br>
                    Step 2: Add the cumulative frequency column to the table by finding the cumulative frequency up
                    to<br><br>
                    each observation.<br><br>
                    Step 3: If the number of observations is odd, the median is the observation whose cumulative<br><br>
                    frequency is just greater than or equal to (n+1)/2<br><br>
                    If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of observations whose
                    cumulative<br><br>
                    frequency is just greater than or equal to n/2 and (n/2)+1.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cumulative Frequency</strong> <br><b>r</b>
                    Cumulative frequency is obtained by adding all the frequencies up to a certain point. <br><br>
                    <strong>Finding median for Grouped Data when class Intervals are given</strong><br><br>
                    Step 1: find the cumulative frequency for all class intervals.<br><br>
                    Step 2: the median class is the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than or nearest to
                    n2,<br><br>
                    where n is the number of observations.<br><br>
                    Step 3: Median = l + [(N/2 – cf)/f] × h<br><br>
                    Where,<br><br>
                    l = lower limit of median class,<br><br>
                    n = number of observations,<br><br>
                    cf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,<br><br>
                    f = frequency of median class,<br><br>
                    h = class size (assuming class size to be equal).<br><br>
                    <strong>Cumulative Frequency distribution of less than type</strong> <br><br>
                    Cumulative frequency of the less than type indicates the number of observations which are less
                    than<br><br>
                    or equal to a particular observation.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cumulative Frequency distribution of more than type</strong><br><br>
                    Cumulative frequency of more than type indicates the number of observations that are greater than
                    or<br><br>
                    equal to a particular observation.<br><br>
                    <strong>Mode</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>Finding mode for Grouped Data when class intervals are not given</strong><br><br>
                    In grouped data without class intervals, the observation having the largest frequency is the mode.<br><br>

                    <strong>Finding mode for Ungrouped Data</strong><br><br>
                    For ungrouped data, the mode can be found out by counting the observations and using tally marks to<br><br>
                    construct a frequency table.<br><br>
                    The observation having the largest frequency is the mode.<br><br>
                    <strong>Finding mode for Grouped Data when class intervals are given</strong> <br><br>
                    For, grouped data, the class having the highest frequency is called the modal class. The mode can be<br><br>
                    calculated using the following formula. The formula is valid for equal class intervals and when the<br><br>
                    modal class is unique.<br><br>
                    Mode = l + [(f1 – f0)/(2f1 – f0 – f2)] × h<br><br>
                    Where,<br><br>
                    l = lower limit of modal class<br><br>
                    h = class width<br><br>
                    f1 = frequency of the modal class<br><br>
                    f0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class<br><br>
                    f2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.<br><br>
