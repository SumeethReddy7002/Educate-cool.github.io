                <p><strong>What is Probability?</strong> <br><br>
                    The branch of mathematics that measures the uncertainty of the occurrence of an event using numbers
                    is<br><br>
                    called probability. The chance that an event will or will not occur is expressed on a scale ranging
                    from 0-1.<br><br>
                    It can also be represented as a percentage, where 0% denotes an impossible event and 100 % implies
                    a<br><br>
                    certain event.<br><br>
                    <strong>Event and outcome</strong> <br><br>
                    An Outcome is a result of a random experiment. For example, when we roll a dice getting six is an
                    outcome. <br><br>
                    An Event is a set of outcomes. For example when we roll dice the probability of getting a
                    number<br><br>
                    less than five is an event.<br><br>
                    Note: An Event can have a single outcome.<br><br>
                    <strong>Experimental Probability</strong> <br><br>
                    Experimental probability can be applied to any event associated with an experiment that is
                    repeated<br><br>
                    a large number of times.<br><br>
                    A trial is when the experiment is performed once. It is also known as empirical probability.<br><br>
                    Experimental or empirical probability: P(E) =Number of trials where the event occurred/Total Number
                    of Trials <br><br>
                    <strong>Theoretical Probability</strong> <br><br>
                    Theoretical Probability, P(E) = Number of Outcomes Favourable to E / Number of all possible outcomes
                    <br><br>
                    of the experiment <br><br>
                    <strong>Elementary Event</strong><br><br>
                    An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary event.<br><br>
                    Example: Take the experiment of tossing a coin n number of times. One trial of this experiment has<br><br>
                    two possible outcomes: Heads(H) or Tails(T). So for an individual toss, it has only one outcome, i.e<br><br>
                    Heads or Tails.<br><br>
                    <Strong>Sum of Probabilities</Strong><br><br>
                    The sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is one.<br><br>
                    Example: take the coin-tossing experiment. P(Heads) + P(Tails ) = (1/2)+ (1/2) =1 <br><br>
                    <strong>Impossible event</strong><br><br>
                    An event that has no chance of occurring is called an Impossible event, i.e. P(E) = 0.<br><br>
                    E.g: Probability of getting a 7 on a roll of a die is 0. As 7 can never be an outcome of this trial.<br><br>
                    <strong>Sure event</strong><br><br>
                    An event that has a 100% probability of occurrence is called a sure event. The probability of<br><br>
                    occurrence of a sure event is one.<br><br>
                    E.g: What is the probability that a number obtained after throwing a die is less than 7?<br><br>
                    So, P(E) = P(Getting a number less than 7) = 6/6= 1<br><br>
                    <strong>Range of Probability of an event</strong><br><br>
                    The range of probability of an event lies between 0 and 1 inclusive of 0 and 1, i.e. 0≤P(E)≤1.<br><br>
                    <strong>Geometric ProbabilityM</strong><br><br>
                    Geometric probability is the calculation of the likelihood that one will hit a particular area of a<br><br>
                    figure. It is calculated by dividing the desired area by the total area. In the case of Geometrical<br><br>
                    probability, there are infinite outcomes.<br><br>
