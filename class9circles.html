                <p><strong>Circles</strong> <br><br>
                    *The set of all the points in a plane that is at a fixed distance from a fixed point makes a circle.
                    <br><br>
                    *A Fixed point from which the set of points are at fixed distance is called the centre of the
                    circle. <br><br>
                    *A circle divides the plane into 3 parts: interior (inside the circle), the circle itself and
                    <br><br>
                    exterior (outside the circle) <br><br>
                    <strong>Radius</strong> <br><br>
                    – The distance between the centre of the circle and any point on its edge is called the radius.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Tangent and Secant</strong> <br><br>
                    A line that touches the circle at exactly one point is called it’s tangent. A line that cuts a
                    <br><br>
                    circle at two points is called a secant. <br><br>
                    <strong>Chord</strong><br><br>
                    -The line segment within the circle joining any 2 points on the circle is called the chord. <br><br>
                    <strong>Diameter</strong><br><br>
                    – A Chord passing through the centre of the circle is called the diameter. – The Diameter is 2
                    times<br><br>
                    the radius and it is the longest chord.<br><br>
                    <strong>Arc</strong><br><br>
                    – The portion of a circle(curve) between 2 points is called an arc. – Among the two pieces made
                    by<br><br>
                    an arc, the longer one is called a major arc and the shorter one is called a minor arc.<br><br>
                    <strong>Circumference</strong><br><br>
                    The perimeter of a circle is the distance covered by going around its boundary once. The
                    perimeter<br><br>
                    of a circle has a special name: Circumference, which is π times the diameter which is given by
                    the<br><br>
                    formula 2πr<br><br>
                    <strong>Segment and Sector</strong><br><br>
                    – A circular segment is a region of a circle which is “cut off” from the rest of the circle by
                    a<br><br>
                    secant or a chord. – Smaller region cut off by a chord is called minor segment and the bigger
                    region<br><br>
                    is called major segment. <br><br>
                    -A sector is the portion of a circle enclosed by two radii and an arc, where the smaller area
                    is<br><br>
                    known as the minor sector and the larger being the major sector.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cyclic Quadrilateral: </strong> <br><br>
                    A quadrilateral ABCD is called cyclic if all the four vertices of it lie on a <br><br>
                    circle. <br><br>

                    Common Chord: The intersection point of two circles is the common chord of the circle. <br><br>
                    <strong>Important Theorems</strong><br><br>
                    *The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord and it is vice-versa.<br><br>
                    *Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant from the centre.<br><br>
                    *It two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding, arcs are congruent and conversely, if<br><br>
                    two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal.<br><br>
                    *Congruent arcs of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.<br><br>
                    *The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it any point on the<br><br>
                    remaining part of the circle.<br><br>
                    *Angle in the same segment of a circle is equal.<br><br>
                    *The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180° and vice-versa.<br><br>
                    *The angle in a semi-circle is a right angle.<br><br>
                    *If two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs (minor, major or semi-circle) are<br><br>
                     congruent and vice-versa.<br><br>
