                    1. Postulates: The basic facts which are taken, for granted, without proof and which are specific to
                    <br><br>
                    2. Axioms: The basic facts which are taken for granted, without proof and which are used
                    throughout<br><br>
                    in the mathematics are called axioms. <br><br>
                    3. Theorem: The conclusions obtained through logical reasoning based on previously proved results
                    <br><br>
                    and some axioms constitute a statement known as a theorem or a proposition.<br><br>
                    4. Point: A point is represented by a fine dot made by a sharp pencil on a sheet of paper.<br><br>
                    5. Plane: The surface of a smooth wall or the surface of a sheet of paper or the surface of a
                    smooth<br><br>
                    black board are close examples of a plane.<br><br>
                    6. Line: A line is breadthless length e.g.. if we fold a piece of paper, the crease in the
                    paper<br><br>
                    represents a geometrical straight line. The edge of a ruler, the edge of the top of a table,
                    the<br><br>
                    meeting place of two walls of a room are some examples of a geometrical straight line.<br><br>
                    7. Incidence Axioms: Axiom 1: A line contains infinitely many points. Axiom 2: Through a
                    given<br><br>
                    point, infinitely many lines can pass through. Axiom 3: In given two points A and B, there is
                    one<br><br>
                    and only one line that contains both the points.<br><br>
                    8. Collinear Points: Three or more points are said to be collinear, if there is a line which<br><br>
                    contains all of them.<br><br>
                    9. Concurrent Lines: Three or more lines are said to be concurrent, if there is a point which
                    lies<br><br>
                    on all of them.<br><br>
                    10. Intersecting Lines: Two lines which meet at one point are said to be intersecting lines.<br><br>
                    The common point is called the ‘point of intersection’.<br><br>
                    Note: Two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.<br><br>
                    11. Parallel Lines: Two lines l and m in a plane are said to be parallel lines, if l ∩ m = ϕ. If l
                    <br><br>
                    and m are two parallel lines in a plane, we can write l ‖ m.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/elements-1.jpg" alt="elements-1">
                    12. Parallel Axiom: If l is a line and P is a point not on line l, there is one and only one line m
                    <br><br>
                    which passes through P and is parallel to l. <br><br>
                    <img src="images/elements-2.jpg" alt="elements-2">
                    13. Two lines which are both parallel to the same line, are parallel to each other. <br><br>
                    14. If l, m, n are three lines in the same plane such that l intersects m and n ‖ m, then l<br><br>
                    intersects n also.<br><br>
                    15. If land m are intersecting lines, l ‖ p and q ‖ m, then p and q also intersect.<br><br>
                    16. If lines AB, AC, AD and AE are parallel to a line l, then points A, B, C, D and E are
                    collinear.<br><br>
                    17. Line Segment: In given two points A and B on a line l, the connected part (segment) of the
                    line<br><br>
                    with end points at A and B, is called the line segment AB.<br><br>
                    18. Interior Point of a Line Segment: A point P is called an interior point of a line segment AB,
                    if<br><br>
                    P ε AB but P is neither A nor B.<br><br>
                    19. Congruence of Line Segments: Two line segments AB and CD are congruent, if the trace-copy of
                    one<br><br>
                    can be superposed on the other so as to cover it completely and exactly.<br><br>
                    20. Line Segment Length Axiom: Every line segment has a length. It is measured in terms of
                    ‘metre’<br><br>
                    or Its parts.<br><br>
                    21. Congruent Line Segment Length Axiom: Two congruent line segments have equal length and<br><br>
                    conversely, two line segments of equal length are congruent, i.e., AB ≌ CD ⇔ l (AB) = l
                    (CD).<br><br>
                    22. Line Segment Addition Axiom: If C is any interior point of a line segment AB, then<br><br>
                    <img src="images/elements-3.jpg" alt="elements-3"> <br><br>
                    23. Line Segment Construction Axiom: Given a point O on a line l and a positive real number r, there
                    <br><br>
                    are exactly two points P1 and P2 on l, on either side of O such that l (OP1) = l (OP2) = r cm.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/elements-4.jpg" alt="elements-4"> <br><br>
                    24. Distance between Two Points: The distance between two points P and Q is the length of the line
                    <br><br>
                    segment joining them and it is denoted by PQ. <br><br>
                    25. Betweenness: Point C is said to lie between the two points A and B, if (a) A, B and C are
                    <br><br>
                    collinear points and (n) AC + CB = AB <br><br>
                    <img src="images/elements-5.jpg" alt="elements-5"> <br><br>
                    26. Mid-point of a Line Segment: Given a line segment AB, a point M is said to be the mid-point of
                    <br><br>
                    AB, if M is an interior point of AB such that AM = MB. <br><br>
                    Line through M, other than line AB is called the bisector of the segment AB. <br><br>
                    27. Opposite Rays: Two rays AB and AC are said to be opposite rays if they are collinear and point A<br><br>
                    is the only common point of these two rays. Note: Two rays or two line segments or a line segment<br><br>
                    and a ray (line) are said to be parallel, if the lines containing them are parallel.<br><br>
                    28. Euclid’s Five Postulates: (a) A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other<br><br>
                    point. (b) A terminated line can be produced indefinitely. (c) A circle can be drawn with any centre<br><br>
                    and any radius. (d) All right angles are equal to one another. (e) If a straight line falling on two<br><br>
                    straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side of it, taken together less than two right <br><br>
                    angles, then the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles <br><br>
                    are less than two right angles. <br><br>
                    29. Some Euclid’s axioms: (a) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. (b)<br><br>
                    If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal. (c) If equals are subtracted from equals, the<br><br>
                    remainders are equal. (d) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. (e) The<br><br>
                    whole is greater than the part. (f) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one<br><br>
                    another. (g) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.<br><br>
                    30. A system of axioms is called consistent, if it is impossible to deduce from these axioms a<br><br>
                    statement that contradicts any axioms or previously proved statement.<br><br>
