                    <h3>Sets</h3>
                    <p> In mathematics set is defined as the collection of well defined object which can be separated distinctly.
                    <br> For instance, <br><br>
                        S = {2, 4, 6, 8} is collection of the even integers. <br><br>
                    <p>*A set can be explained in different ways: <br><br>
                        i. Listing method: A = a, b, c, .z<br><br>
                        ii. Descriptive method: N = the natural numbersfrom 1 to 50<br><br>
                        iii. Set builder method: A – B= A -(A∩ B ) <br><br>
                         iv. Venn – diagram </p> <br><br>
                <strong>Universal sets</strong> <br>
             <p>*A universal set is the collection of all objects in a particular context or theory. All other sets in that <br>
            framework constitute subsets of the universal set, which is denoted as letter U. The objects themselves are <br>
            known as elements or members of U.
            <p><br><br>
            <strong>Subsets</strong> <br>
            <p>*The set made by elements of the universal sets is called subsets of the universal sets <br>
                For example <br><br>
                U = 1, 2, 3, 4, …………..50<br><br>
                A = {even integers from 1 to 50} <br><br>
                B= {odd numbers from 1 to 50} <br><br>
                Here, A and B are the subsets of
            <p><br><br>
            <strong>Overlapping sets</strong> <br>
            <p>Two sets are said to be overlapped if they have same element in common. <br><br>
              A∩B = {6}<br><br>
              A and B are overlapping sets.</p><br><br>
            <strong>Disjoint sets</strong> <br>
            <p>Two sets are said to be disjoint sets if there is no element in common.</p>
            <strong>cardinality of a set</strong><br>
            <p>cardinality of a set measured by the number of elements it contains.</p>
            <strong>Roster Form</strong>
            <p> Roster or tabular form: In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated
            <br>
            by commas and are enclosed within braces { }. For Example: Z=the set of all integers={…,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,…}
            </p>
            <strong>Set-builder form</strong>
            <p>A set-builder notation describes the elements of a set instead of listing the elements. For example, the set { 5,
            <br>
            6, 7, 8, 9} list the elements.
            </p>
            <strong>Empty Set </strong>
            <p>If a set doesn’t have any elements, it is known as an empty set or null set or void set. For e.g. consider the
            <br>
            set, <br><br>
            P = {x : x is a leap year between 1904 and 1908}</p>
            <strong>Singleton Set</strong>
            <p>If a set contains only one element, then it is called a singleton set. For e.g. <br><br>
            A = {x : x is an even prime number}</p>
            <strong>Finite Set</strong>
             <p> If a set contains no element or a definite number of elements, it is called a finite set. <br>
            If the set is non-empty, it is called a non-empty finite set. Some examples of finite sets are: <br>
            A = {x : x is a month in a year}; Set A will have 12 elements</p>
            <strong>Infinite Set</strong>
            <p>it will have infinite elements. If a given set is not finite, then it will be an infinite <br> </set>
               A = {x : x is a natural number}; There are infinite natural numbers. Hence, A is an infinite set. <br>
               For e.g. <br>
            </p>
            <strong>Power Set</strong>
             <p>The power set of a set A is the set which consists of all the subsets of the set A. It is denoted by P(A). <br>
              Example: If set A = {-9,13,6}, then power set of A will be: <br>
              P(A)={ϕ, {-9}, {13}, {6}, {-9,13}, {13,6}, {6,-9}, {-9,13,6}}
