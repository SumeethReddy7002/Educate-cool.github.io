                <strong>Algebraic Expressions</strong>
                <p>An algebraic expression is an expression made up of variables and constants along with mathematical
                    <br>
                    operators. <br><br>
                    An algebraic expression is a sum of terms, which are considered to be building blocks for <br>
                    expressions. <br> <br>
                    A term is a product of variables and constants. A term can be an algebraic expression in itself.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of a term – 3 which is just a constant. <br>
                    – 2x, which is the product of constant ‘2’ and the variable ‘x’ <br>
                    – 4xy, which is the product of the constant ‘4’ and the variables ‘x’ and ‘y’. <br>
                    – 5x2y, which is the product of 5, x, x and y. <br>
                    The constant in each term is referred to as the coefficient. <br>
                    Example of an algebraic expression: 3x2y+4xy+5x+6 which is the sum of four terms: 3x2y, 4xy, 5x and
                    <br>
                    6. <br><br>
                    An algebraic expression can have any number of terms. The coefficient in each term can be any real
                    <br>
                    number. There can be any number of variables in an algebraic expression. The exponent on the <br>
                    variables, however, must be rational numbers.
                </p>
                <strong>Polynomial</strong>
                <p>An algebraic expression can have exponents that are rational numbers. However, a polynomial is an
                    <br>
                    algebraic expression in which the exponent on any variable is a whole number. <br><br>
                    5x3+3x+1 is an example of a polynomial. It is an algebraic expression as well. <br> <br>
                    2x+3√x is an algebraic expression, but not a polynomial. – since the exponent on x is 1/2 which is
                    not a whole number.
                </p>
                <strong>Degree of a Polynomial</strong>
                <p>For a polynomial in one variable – the highest exponent on the variable in a polynomial is the degree
                    <br>
                    of the polynomial. <br><br>
                    Example: The degree of the polynomial x2+2x+3 is 2, as the highest power of x in the given <br>
                    expression is x2.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Types Of Polynomials</strong> <br> <br>
                    Polynomials can be classified based on: <br>
                    a) Number of terms <br>
                    b) Degree of the polynomial. <br><br>
                    <strong>Types of polynomials based on the number of terms</strong> <br> <br>
                    a) Monomial – A polynomial with just one term. Example: 2x, 6x^2, 9xy <br>

                    b) Binomial – A polynomial with two terms. Example: 4x^2+x, 5x+4 <br>

                    a) Trinomial – A polynomial with three terms. Example: x^2+3x+4 <br> <br>
                    <strong>Types of Polynomials based on Degree</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong>Linear Polynomial</strong><br><br>
                    A polynomial whose degree is one is called a linear <br>
                    For example, 2x+1 is a linear polynomial. <br>
                    Quadratic Polynomial <br>
                    A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. <br>
                    For example, 3x2+8x+5 is a quadratic polynomial.

                    <strong>Zeroes of a Polynomial</strong> <br><br>
                    A zero of a polynomial p(x) is the value of x for which the value of p(x) is 0. If k is a zero of p(x),
                then p(k)=0. <br>
                For example, consider a polynomial p(x)=x2−3x+2. <br>
                When x=1, the value of p(x) will be equal to <br>
                p(1)=12−3×1+2 <br>
                =1−3+2 <br>
                =0 <br>
                <strong>Number of Zeros</strong> <br><br>
                In general, a polynomial of degree n has at most n Zeros <br>
                A linear polynomial has one zero, <br><br>
                A quadratic polynomial has at most two zeros.<br><br>
                A cubic polynomial has at most 3 zeros.<br><br>
                Factorisation of Polynomials<br><br>
                Quadratic polynomials can be factorized by splitting the middle term.<br><br>
                For example, consider the polynomial 2x2−5x+3 <br><br>
                Splitting the middle term:<br><br>
                The middle term in the polynomial 2x2−5x+3 is -5x. This must be expressed as a sum of two terms such<br><br>
                that the product of their coefficients is equal to the product of 2 and 3 (coefficient of x2 and the<br><br>
                constant term)<br><br>
                −5 can be expressed as (−2)+(−3), as −2×−3=6=2×3<br><br>
                Thus, 2x2−5x+3=2x2−2x−3x+3 <br><br>
                Now, identify the common factors in individual groups <br>v
                2x2−2x−3x+3=2x(x−1)−3(x−1)<br><br>
                Taking (x−1) as the common factor, this can be expressed as: <br><br>
                2x(x−1)−3(x−1)=(x−1)(2x−3) <br><br>
